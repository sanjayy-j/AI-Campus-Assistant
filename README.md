# AI Campus Assistant

## Overview

AI Campus Assistant is an incremental learning project focused on understanding how AI assistants are built using pre-trained language models. The project starts with a simple question–answering system and gradually evolves by adding more capabilities only when required.

## Project Philosophy

This project follows a learning-first and engineering-first approach. Each stage is built with the simplest correct solution before introducing additional complexity. The focus is on understanding system design decisions rather than rushing to advanced features.

## Project Levels

- **Level 1:** Simple question–answering using a pre-trained large language model.
- **Level 2:** Context-aware responses using external documents.
- **Level 3:** Agent-based reasoning and task planning.
